# Inter Soft

Inter Soft is a variant of the typeface [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) by [Rasmus Andersson](https://github.com/rsms).
The rounded corners are automatically generated by a tool called Glyphs Mini therefore some glyphs might not look perfect.
Inter Soft was originally created to be used in my app Superchat.
